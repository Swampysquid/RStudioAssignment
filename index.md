# RStudio Visualizations of the CDC's Death Data for 2020
### By: Eythan Jenkins

## Introduction

In 2020, Heart disease was the leading cause of death for Americans. However, this doesn't mean that it was the leading cause of death for ALL Americans. Once you change the scope from wide to narrow, and break the population down into different demographics, you get to see how different people face different challenges. This is the core discovery that I made when looking at the CDC's Data for the Leading Causes of Death: depending on sex, race, and age groups, variance appears in their leading causes of death. Therefore, when looking at the leading causes of death, it can be beneficial to break it down into subsections. 

I support this discovery with the data visulaizations I created. They will show the leading causes of death as a whole, and then broken down into different demographics. When broken into different demographics, it becomes clear that while heart disease is a major issue (it is still the leading cause of death after all), putting all Americans under the umbrella of heart disease being their biggest obstacle, may be a bit misleading.

## Dataset

I acquired my data from the U.S. Government's Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's website. The CDC's Mission is "to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S." (CDC, 2022) Therefore, it is their duty to collect information on how Americans are dying, as they need to take steps to mitigate these threats of death.

The data from them that I am using is their Leading Cause of Death Reports, whcih span from 1981 - 2020. I am interested in their 2020 data only, as it is the most recent available data that they have to show, and will be most representative of the current year, 2022.
